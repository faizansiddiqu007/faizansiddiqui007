I started in tech with a focus on language and data during my time at Jamia Millia Islamia, publishing research on multilingual NLP.

At CommVersion, I built AI tools for chat compliance, lead generation, and system optimization.

I’ve led projects across RAG systems, AI agents, and multimodal models, always focused on making AI useful and explainable.

Now, I’m building AI products that work in the real world — and mentoring others to do the same.

Let’s build something that matters.
